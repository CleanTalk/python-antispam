## How API stops spam?

- Spam bots signatures.
- Blacklists checks by Email, IP, web-sites domain names.
- JavaScript availability.
- Comment submit time.
- Relevance test for the comment.

## How API works?
API sends a comment's text and several previous approved comments to the servers. Servers evaluates the relevance of the comment's text on the topic, tests on spam and finaly provides a solution - to publish or put on manual moderation of comments. If a comment is placed on manual moderation, the plugin adds to the text of a comment explaining the reason for the ban server publishing.

	sender_email = 'stop_email@example.com', # Visitor email
