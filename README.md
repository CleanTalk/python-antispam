## SPAM test for text comment sample 

```python
from cleantalk import CleanTalk
import json


ct = CleanTalk(auth_key='yourkey')
ct_result = ct.request(
                message = 'abc', # Required. Visitor comment
                sender_ip = '196.19.250.114', # Required. Visitor IP address
                sender_email = 'stop_email@example.com', # Required. Visitor email
                sender_nickname = 'spam_bot', # Required. Visitor nickname
                post_info= json.dumps({'post_url': 'https://yoursite.com'}) # Optional. Additional post info in JSON format.
                # event_token = 'xxx' # fill it with ct_bot_detector_event_token hidden input from your form (auto generate)
        )
#Check
if ct_result['allow']:
    print('Comment allowed. Reason ' + ct_result['comment'])
else:
    print('Comment blocked. Reason ' + ct_result['comment'])
```
